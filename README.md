# threejs-golang-native
Native Go WebAssembly port of three.js

**Project Status: Experimental**
This project is an experimental effort to port three.js natively to Go using WebAssembly. Currently, not all features and functionalities of three.js are fully supported, and the API may change as development progresses.

### Overview
The goal of `threejs-golang-native` is to enable developers to create rich 3D scenes in Go, leveraging the power of Three.js while maintaining Goâ€™s strong typing and native capabilities via WebAssembly.

### Features
- Basic scene rendering
- Geometry and mesh creation
- Initial camera and light support

### Limitations
- Not all Three.js features are implemented yet
- Some APIs may have breaking changes as development continues
- Performance optimizations are ongoing

### Getting Started
Include instructions on how to set up and use the library in a simple WebAssembly project.

### Contributing
We welcome contributions and feedback. If you are interested in helping shape this project, feel free to submit issues or pull requests.

> **Note:** Since this library is under active development, expect breaking changes and frequent updates. The goal is to achieve a full and efficient port, but it will take time.
